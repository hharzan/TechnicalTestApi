# This repo is intended to demonstrate a basic API that stores receivables and debtor data. 
# This API also provides basic statistics that can be derived based on aforementioned receivables data. 
# Assumptions: 
- Debtors and Receivables are CRUD-friendly.
- Receivables have specific fields that are not modifiable after initial addition to DB context.
- Debtors have specific fields that are not modifiable after initial addition to DB context.
- This API has no web interface aside from standard Swagger UI.
- Time spent was roughly 24 hours of continuous development combined.
- No encryption or authentication token system for accessing endpoints.
- DB is SQL Express/SQL Server and is assumed to be local DB.
